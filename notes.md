root is where we pin app from js

jsx is template language // html in java

state something to complete or delete to use for data

use state need a a blank variable of new term to set the array to 0 
const [bar, setBar] = useState(0) <-- array destructure>
        var  fnct ^     initial state
destructure allows a breakdown of the array indeses without using map or such

onclick handlers like event handlers
<button onClick= {() => setCount(count + 1)}>add</button>
to allow to work need to use the var where you want to see state change
